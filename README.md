Bloc Architecture<br>
This app follows the Bloc (Business Logic Component) architecture pattern for managing state and data flow. The<br> Bloc pattern helps in separating business logic from the UI layer, making the code more modular, <br>testable, and maintainable.<br>
<br>
Within the presentation folder, each screen or component has its own directory, which includes the UI code and a<br> corresponding Bloc class. This separation allows for clear separation of concerns and easier testing of the<br> individual components<br>
<br>
The final output screens developed are as follows:<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="pic2.jpg"></td>
<td><img src="pic1.jpg"></td>
<td><img src="pic3.jpg"></td>
<td>![Screen1](c:/Users/Firos/Downloads/Screenshot_20230530_221324.jpg)</td>
</tr>
</table>
